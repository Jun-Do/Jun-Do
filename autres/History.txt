Chūson-ji(中尊寺):

It's History:
The Chūson-ji Temple was found, according to the Tendai Boudhiste school, in the year 850 by Ennin (Jikaku Daishi). However according to specialists it was created at the beginning of the 12th century by Fujiwara no Kiyohira,
the founder of the Ōshū Fujiwara clan because no archaeological traces of Buddhist presence were found in this area before 1100. It is located in the north of the city but it is considered to be its spiritual center.
The various altars in the Konjiki-dō contain the momified bodies of the Ōshū Fujiwara members such as Fujiwara no Kiyohira,  Fujiwara no Motohira or
Fujiwara no Hidehira and his son Fujiwara no Yasuhira's head.
Kyôzô contains the national treasures that are the sutras Konshi-kinginji-kôsho-issaikyô and the Konshi-kinji-issaikyô. The sutras are books containing the words pronounced by the Buddha.
According to the Azumakagami, a historical document dating from the beginning of the 14th century, the Chūson-ji would have gathered around him 40 halls and 300 prayer residence at the end of the 12th century.
This temple is accompanied by a vow of its creator to make it possible to reach the pure Buddhist land to all allied and enemy soldiers who have lost their lives in the many battles since the conquest of the Emishi in the 8th century.


Its architecture:
The temple consists of three buildings:
- The Main Pavilion (rebuilt in 1909)
- The Kyôzô or sutra's pavilion (rebuilt during the Kamakura period (1185-1333)), It is a 7.72 square metre wooden construction with a pyramidal copper roof..
This building has been renovated 5 times since 1930, the last time in 2008.
- The Konjiki-dō (the only building to have kept its original appearance)
The Konjiki-dō is entirely covered with gold leaf and traditional Japanese lacquer except for its roof, mother-of-pearl inlays are used in the decorations.  It make the size of a square of approximately 5.48 metres.
The structure of the building is made of rosewood (Pterocarpus indicus) and Java bishop's wood (Bischofi ajavanica), in addition there is designs of tropical green snail shells on the mother-of-pearl.
The structure rests on 4 pillars reinforced by 8 nailed plates to prevent them from breaking.
It consists of 33 gilded statues in the altar room. Once in the open air, a wooden building was created to protect it in 1288 and then rebuilt in the 15th century, named Konjikidô Ôidô and it is still standing and can be visited.
Today it is protected by a concrete building and only visible through a thick acrylic glass at the front.
Various archaeological excavations have uncovered traces of pillars, moats, ponds, paths and wells.
Between 1897 and 1991 numerous renovations took place.

Its history:
The Temple Mōtsū-ji is composed of two ruined buildings: Enryū-ji (圓隆寺) and Kashō-ji (嘉祥寺).
On this site said to had a first temple created by Fujiwara no Kiyohira which burnt down after its completion.
It was then his son Fujiwara no Motohira, who had the Enryū-ji built in 1150 which would be a perfect copy of his father's temple. Once the construction was finished, he then had a perfect copy built which he named Kashō-ji.
At its peak, Mōtsū-ji would have housed 40 halls and 500 prayer residence.
In 1226 the main hall of the Enryû-ji burned down.
Even today religious rituals are still performed within this temple.
Other smaller buildings were built in the surroundings, such as the Kôdô ato, the Hokkedô ato or the Jôgiôdô ato.

Its architecture:

The structure of the Mōtsū-ji temple is most certainly a copy of the Hosshô-ji temple in Shirakawa, east of Kyoto. Its orientation was designed to face Mount Kinkeisan.
The Enryū-ji is said to have housed a statue of Yakushi as well as the twelve Celestial Generals in a room painted in bright colours and decorated with precious woods, gold, silver and jewellery. 
Kashō-ji would have had for only difference walls representing the Sūtra of the Lotus with painting.
The buildings consist of a main hall and then corridors to the east and west of the building and then to the south. At the end of these corridors there is the Kyôrô where sutras where stocked and the Shôrô.
In front of these buildings is a garden called Môtsû-ji Teien mainly composed of a lake with an island inside. This island was formerly connected by a 190-metre bridge perfectly centred on the Enryū-ji
This garden also consists of a standing stone about 2 metres high. This garden was built following the philosophy defined in the Sakuteiki summarised and translated into "Respect and learn from nature".

Kanjizaiō-in Ato:

The Kanjizaiō-in Ato was a Buddhist temple with a garden. It was created by the wife of Fujiwara no Motohira, it is possible that it was, before being a temple, her apartment.
It would have consisted of a large main building, the Dai-amidadô, and a smaller one, the Shô-amidadô.
The garden has a 100-metre pond called "Maizurugaike" which means dancing skull pond and has an island about 30 metres long. The pond was designed to have the shape of a turtle or a skull.
A waterfall can be seen there.
The pond has its source in the pond of Mōtsū-ji, it was created especially to represent the Buddhist pure land ideology of Amida Buddha.
Religious rituals still take place around the ruins of the temple.

Muryōkō-in Ato:
The Muryōkō-in Ato was built in the 12th century by Fujiwara no Hidehira grandson of Fujiwara no Kiyohira, it is located to the east of the hiraizumi site. It was a Buddhist temple accompanied by a garden. Today they are ruins
on which an archaeological site is located. It seems that the Muryôkô-in temple, the only building, was 5 meters high and 250 wide. Thanks to the archaeological research we know that the building
was at the centre of a pond that has now disappeared. It was also possible to represent in an image this temple.

Mont Kinkeisan:

Also called the sacred mountain of Mount Kinkeisan which means "the mountain of the golden cockerel". It has a maximum height of 98.6 metres. The Ôshû Fujiwara clan has built a mound on it made of sutra that
symbolises the direction towards pure Buddhism. The sutras were buried to preserve them until Bodhisattva Maitreya, the future Buddha, came down to our world to preach.
The majority of the temples and gardens of Hiraizumi are oriented towards this Mount in order to represent the pure Buddhist land. An archaeological site is located on it.
